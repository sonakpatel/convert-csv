convert-csv
===========

A little hack app to convert a csv file into json, to merge data from one Parse DB to another.

Whilst at Fidel, we had a test database with a lot of generated data. There was no way to get this info from one db to another. We could however download the data as a csv file. This data was processed and converted to be re-inserted to the new database structure.
